# Wish list

The biggest task on my wishlist was to combine the six or so functions that formed earlier versions of the splithalf package into a single, unified, function. This I have achieved, so in no particular order I have some things I still want to achieve with this package in future versions. If you have any more, please contact me and I will add them to my list

* prettier output
* multilevel approaches to estimating reliability - though this would deviate from splithalf somewhat
* error tracking
    * in testing the function, having little data for one participant, e.g. only two trials in one condition, leads to errors gone wild. So, I'd like to add some checking functionality, perhaps as a separate _splithalf-checker_ function in the package.
